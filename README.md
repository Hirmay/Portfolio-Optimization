# Portfolio-Optimization
- Perfect market efficiency only exists in the books of finance. The world that we live in is full
of uncertainty and has various factors affecting the capital markets. As to beat inflation and
yield returns on the liquid funds that one has we tend to direct our energy in managing our
funds based on our risk appetite to get the desired returns.
- Let us assume a company or people which has a platform which wants to maximize their
returns while minimizing the risk taken. The platform seeks to provide customers with a
low-cost, high-quality, one-stop online investment solution for their retirement portfolios. The
company builds each client's portfolio using algorithms to keep prices down. The algorithms
select from a range of investing possibilities and styles.
- Our Project includes research that selects the fund with the greatest investment potential using
important risk-management indicators which are going to be backed with some visualized stats
that helps us understand the outcomes clearly. The funds are American-based private
investment management companies which are then compared with the S&P 500 index of the
American Equity Markets.
